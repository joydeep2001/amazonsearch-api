# amazonsearch-api
its just a project I am trying out nothing new.
Hi I am Ramik Mukherjee
I am an aspiring data scientist
currently exploring the field and learning new things like this one its scraping module in python(webscraper)
In this project I tried to search amazon with a product and then collected the data(name and price to be specific)
after collecting you have to validate in json format from jsonlint website.
to use the code u will need a file which will help the code the specific values to look for its included
u will need two modules for this 1. autoscraper 2. flask
Thank you
